An app to help the visually impaired.

## Premise

People who are visually impaired or even have a few problems with eyesight find it hard to read.
With this app, I hope to make that a little easier. Using Artificial intelligence provided by
google's MLkit and text recognition algorithms, This app will be able to read out any text the 
camera is pointed towards.
